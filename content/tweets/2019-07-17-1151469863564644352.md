Is it possible that [@googlechrome](https://twitter.com/@googlechrome) for [@debian](https://twitter.com/@debian) dev channel isnt being updated any more?

I haven't received an update for several weeks now. Before, I received at least weekly updates. I'm stuck on Version 77.0.3833.0 (Official Build) dev (64-bit)
