I've moved (almost) all of my [@jekyllrb](https://twitter.com/@jekyllrb) and [@GoHugoIO](https://twitter.com/@GoHugoIO) #Jamstack sites to [@Netlify](https://twitter.com/@Netlify).

Great interface, performance and reliablity. Can't wait to upgrade to enterprise High-Performance ADN if my business grows to that point in a future day ðŸ˜ƒ
